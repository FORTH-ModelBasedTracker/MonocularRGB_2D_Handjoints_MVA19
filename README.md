# Accurate Hand Keypoint Localization on Mobile Devices

![overview](res/cropped_overview.png)

Use the pretrained network of the paper "Accurate Hand Keypoints Localization on Mobile Devices" to extract hand joint heatmaps from RGB hand images.
The network is light enought (based on a mobilenet2 backend) to work on mobile phones.
